The most interesting project is AD4000.
In this project, a AD7276 ADC is used to measure an analog signal.
The data is read from the ADC via SPI.
The data is then sent to a computer via UART using the STLINK V3 interface
The PCB used in this example can be found at https://oshwlab.com/tulanthoar1/ad4000sch
Note that the PCB was originally made for the AD4000 converter, and I suggest you modify this project to use that if you are able to solder 0.5 mm pin pitch ICs.
